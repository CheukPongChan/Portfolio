									<p>Throughout my Mphil studies and full-time Research Assistant career, I had taken part in major teaching duties in 6 different University courses or workshops for over 3 years. My responsibilities as a course tutor ranged from preparing tutorial notes prior to start of semester, to solving technical questions faced by students at any given time during the tutoring session. I mainly educate students on how to create VR applications via Unity and our in-house VR plugin -- VotanicXR.</p>
									<p>In my opinion, the most rewarding factor as a University tutor, is how I can utilize VR experiences to facilitate teaching by creating immersive VR applications and tools for students to interact with. This way pupils can be actively involved in the course content and gain a concrete understanding of it through straight-forward visualization.</p>
