									<p>Draw and Guess is a fun online drawing game that can be played with friends anywhere. The game design is much inspired by Gartic.io and Gartic Phone. During each round, players take turns to become the drawer, who needs to draw out a word for others to guess. Whoever hits the right answer first will gain the most points, and the subsequent correct guessers will be rewarded one point less, and so on. The drawer will also be given one point for each correct guess. After 10 subrounds, the player who has the most points wins.</p>
									<p>Although the general game flow of Draw and Guess is similar to Gartic.io and Gartic Phone, I added an important feature to increase its replayability. In Draw and Guess, drawers are able to choose what word they like for others to guess before drawing. Unlike Gartic.io, where drawers are required to choose between a few preset words each time. The new feature can promote creativity in the drawings and target words, and make the overall experience much more fun for every player, in my opinion. Although Gartic Phone also allows players to choose their own "phrase" to draw, the round duration of a normal game scales up by a lot depending on the number of players. Draw and Guess provides a much faster and simplier gameplay experience for players who can't afford much game time.</p>
