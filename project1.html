							<p>In The Soul Vanquisher, you play as a member from the government special task force who is trying to investigate a massive missing persons case. Not long after, you awake in a unknown underground dungeon and you have to uncover the secrets behind it in order to find an exit to the hellhole. The dungeon is filled with items and collectibles for the player to scavenge, as well as moving traps to prevent any escaping. Not only that, A mysterious figure lurks around the dungeon and anyone who is brave enough to confront it without the right gear, will face consequences.</p>
							<p>The game starts off as an "Escape Room" experience, where the player is passively trying to gather resources and intel about the dungeon. As the game goes on, the player gains strength through hints from diary pages and stronger weapons, and will be able to face off against the creature at the end.</p>
